- **Technical Implementation**: Full-stack architecture, database design, performance optimization

## 📊 Key Portfolio Components

### [Executive Dashboard](./portfolio/executive-dashboard.md)
High-level KPIs, critical alerts, and strategic procurement metrics with real-time performance tracking.

### [Daily MRP Report](./portfolio/daily-mrp-report.md)
Operational procurement workflow demonstrating the daily process of managing inventory levels, supplier orders, and production commitments.

### [Supplier Performance Analysis](./portfolio/supplier-analysis.md)
Comprehensive vendor management insights including performance scorecards, risk assessment, and strategic partnership recommendations.

### [Stock Flow Visualization](./portfolio/stock-flow-diagram.md)
Detailed inventory movement tracking showing the complete lifecycle from purchase order to consumption.

### [System Architecture](./portfolio/system-architecture.md)
Enterprise-level technical implementation including database design, API architecture, security, and deployment strategies.

## 🏭 Real-World Application

This system design reflects actual procurement experience including:

- **Daily Operations**: Processing MRP reports, managing supplier relationships, coordinating with production teams

- **Process Improvement**: Automation of manual workflows, performance tracking, exception handling

### Core Business Logic
```
Stock Status = (Available + Holding + Incoming - Expired - Rejected) / Min Stock
Color Coding: Green (>80%) → Yellow (60-80%) → Orange (40-60%) → Light Red (20-40%) → Red (<20%)
```
