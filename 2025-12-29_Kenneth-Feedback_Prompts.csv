1,Create Feature Branch,Local (Git),"I need to start working on new requirements without breaking my current app. Show me the git commands to create and switch to a new branch named 'feature-compliance-doc-flow'."
2,Update Data Schema (CAS/INCI),Local (Python),"Update my 'raw_materials.json' generation script. 1. Add two new fields to every item: 'cas_number' (format: XXXX-XX-X) and 'inci_name' (e.g. 'Tocopherol'). 2. Ensure that interchangeable parts share the same CAS/INCI but have different Suppliers. 3. Remove 'SKU' as the primary lookup and use CAS_Number instead."
3,Add Compliance Doc Structure,Local (Python),"Modify the data generator further. Add a 'compliance_package' dictionary to every item. It should have 11 keys representing required documents (e.g., 'sds', 'tech_drawing', 'non_gmo_cert', 'animal_testing_statement', 'allergen_statement', etc.). Set their values to boolean True/False randomly, where only 20% of items have all 11 set to True."
4,Create 'Compliance Agent' Logic,Local (Python),"Write a new Python function called 'check_compliance_completeness'. It takes an item's 'compliance_package'. Logic: 1. Count how many keys are True. 2. If count < 11, return 'MISSING_DOCS' and list which ones are False. 3. If count == 11, return 'READY_FOR_R&D'."
5,Simulate Supplier Portal (Ingest),Local (Python),"Create a python script called 'supplier_portal_sim.py'. It should simulate a supplier uploading a missing document. 1. Ask user for a CAS Number. 2. Show missing docs. 3. Allow user to type 'upload sds'. 4. Update the JSON file to set 'sds' to True for that item."
6,R&D Gate & Sample Request,Local (Bedrock),"Update the main simulation flow. When 'check_compliance_completeness' returns 'READY_FOR_R&D', trigger a Bedrock prompt. Prompt: 'You are a Procurement Agent. The supplier [SupplierName] has submitted all 11 compliance docs for [INCI Name]. Write a polite email to them requesting a 100g sample for our Lab Batch testing. Reference the specific CAS number.'"
7,Verify 'Apples to Apples',Local (Python),"Create a validation script. It should search the database for all items with the same CAS Number. Print a comparison table showing their Price vs. their 'Compliance Score' (x/11 docs ready). This helps R&D see if the cheaper option is actually 'paperwork ready'."
