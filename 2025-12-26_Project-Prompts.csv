3,Create Synthetic Data,"Write a Python script to generate a 'raw_materials.json' file using the 'faker' library. It needs 50 items. Each item must have: SKU, SupplierName, Price, LeadTime, DaysOnHand (integer between 1-30). Crucially, add a dictionary called 'TechnicalSpecs' (e.g. density, tensile_strength, grade). Create at least 3 pairs of items that have DIFFERENT Suppliers and IDs but IDENTICAL 'TechnicalSpecs' to simulate interchangeable parts."
4,Develop Governance Logic,"Write a Python function called 'evaluate_purchase' that takes a 'proposed_item' and a 'current_inventory_item'. Logic: 1. If 'proposed_item' TechnicalSpecs do NOT match 'current_inventory_item', return 'REJECTED: Specs Mismatch'. 2. If Specs match, check Price. If price < $1000, return 'APPROVED'. 3. If price > $1000, return 'PENDING MANAGER'."
7,Build 'The Bridge' (Bedrock),"Write a Python function 'ask_claude' that uses the Boto3 library to send a text prompt to the 'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0' model. It should accept a prompt string, send it to Bedrock, and return only the text response. Include try/except blocks for ClientError."
8,Agent Scenario,"Create a script called 'simulation.py'. 1. Load the JSON data. 2. Find an item with DaysOnHand < 5. 3. Search the JSON for a *substitute* item (different supplier, same Specs). 4. If found, use the 'ask_claude' function to write a short justification email to the R&D department proposing the switch based on price differences."
10,Refactor for Lambda,"I need to move this code to AWS Lambda. Wrap my existing 'evaluate_purchase' and 'ask_claude' logic into a single function: 'def lambda_handler(event, context):'. Show me how to extract the 'sku_to_check' from the 'event' dictionary."
11,Create IAM Roles,"My Lambda function is failing with 'AccessDenied'. Provide the JSON IAM Policy document that grants permission for 'bedrock:InvokeModel' on the Claude 3 Sonnet model. Also include CloudWatch logging permissions."
14,Generate Architecture Diagram,"I want to document this system. Help me install the 'diagrams' python library. Then, write a Python script called 'arch_diagram.py' to generate a PNG image. Visualize: An EventBridge Scheduler triggering a Lambda Function, which reads from a DynamoDB table and calls Bedrock. Use the official AWS icons."
15,Git Backup,"I want to save this project. 1. Generate a '.gitignore' file for a standard Python/AWS environment (ignore venv, .env, __pycache__). 2. Write a README.md summarizing that this is a 'Resilient Procurement Agent Simulation'. 3. Give me the git commands to initialize and push this to a new repo."
